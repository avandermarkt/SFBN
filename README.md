# SFBN
# We tried to fit a multi-state model to our data. In order to do this, we first had to change our data into the wide format (in the original matrix SFBN each culumn was one month). After this, we transformed it into long format and then took the steps to fit this data into a multi-state model. 
# We followed the steps as described in the mstate manual: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mstate/mstate.pdf
